# Is the TW Too Small for Me? Riding Options for Tall Riders

If you're a tall rider like me, standing at an impressive 6'2" with a 34" inseam, you might find yourself wondering if the TW (Yamaha TW200) is the right bike for you. Fear not, my fellow vertically gifted friends, because I have some good news for you.

Based on the experiences of some riders in our community, it seems that the TW can indeed accommodate taller riders without causing any discomfort or feeling too small. One rider, who is 5'10" with a 34" inseam, mentioned that they found the TW to be a perfect fit. They did make a modification to raise the bars using spacer blocks to ensure they could sit more upright, especially while standing. So, with a few adjustments, you can easily tailor the bike to your needs.

Another rider chimed in, mentioning that they stand at 5'10" with a shorter 29" inseam, and they also found the TW to fit them comfortably. This just goes to show that rider height and inseam length aren't the sole determining factors when it comes to finding the right fit.

One important point to note is that the TW is great for two-up riding. Several riders pointed out that the seat height of the TW was the primary reason they purchased the bike, as it was the only dual sport that their partners could easily mount and dismount without the need for a step stool. So, if you're planning on occasional rides with your wife on the back, the TW might actually be an ideal choice.

Living near Pismo beach, your planned riding terrain of back roads, fire roads, hard packed sand on beaches, and dirt trails aligns perfectly with what the TW is designed for. Riders in our community have given positive feedback about its performance on gravel and dirt roads, making it a versatile option for your intended adventures.

In conclusion, while being tall might spark concerns about finding the right fit, it seems that the TW can accommodate riders of various heights. With a few modifications and adjustments, you can make the bike feel comfortable for your riding style. So, embrace your stature, grab your helmet, and get ready to embark on thrilling rides along the beautiful landscapes near Pismo beach. Happy riding!
